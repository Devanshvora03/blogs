                        A grid system is a design tool used to arrange content on
                        a webpage. It is a series of vertical and horizontal lines
                        that create a matrix of intersecting points, which can be
                        used to align and organize page elements. Grid systems are
                        used to create a consistent look and feel across a
                        website, and can help to make the layout more visually
                        appealing and easier to navigate.

                        If you’ve been to New York City and have walked the
                        streets, it is easy to figure out how to get from one
                        place to another because of the grid system that the city
                        is built on. Just as the predictability of a city grid
                        helps locals and tourists get around easily, so do webpage
                        grids provide a structure that guides users and designers
                        alike. Because of their consistent reference point, grids
                        improve page readability and scannability and allow people
                        to quickly get where they need to go.

                        There are three common grid types used in websites and
                        interfaces: column grid, modular grid, and hierarchical
                        grid.

                        Column grid involves dividing a page into vertical
                        columns. UI elements and content are then aligned to these
                        columns.

                        Modular grid extends the column grid further by adding
                        rows to it. This intersection of columns and rows make up
                        modules to which elements and content are aligned. Modular
                        grids are great for ecommerce and listing pages, as rows
                        are repeatable to accommodate browsing.

                        Regardless of the type of grid you are using, the grid is
                        made up of three elements: columns, gutters, and margins.

                        Columns take up most of the real estate in a grid.
                        Elements and content are placed in columns. To adapt to
                        any screen size, column widths are generally defined with
                        percentages rather than fixed values and the number of
                        columns will vary. For example, a grid on a mobile device
                        might have 4 columns and a grid on a desktop might have 12
                        columns.

                        The gutter is the space between columns that separates
                        elements and content from different columns. Gutter widths
                        are fixed values but can change based on different
                        breakpoints. For example, wider gutters are appropriate
                        for larger screens, whereas smaller gutters are
                        appropriate for smaller screens like mobile.

                        margins, while others do not. Breaking the grid like this
                        makes it challenging to focus or quickly scan product
                        images and calls more attention to some products over
                        others. It is okay to break the grid every so often, as
                        long as you have a valid reason for it.

                          A good grid is easy to adapt to various screen sizes and
                          orientations. In fact, grid layouts are an essential
                          component of

                        . Responsive design uses breakpoints to determine the
                        screen size threshold at which the layout should change.
                        For example, a desktop screen may have 12 grid columns,
                        which may be stacked on mobile so that the resulting
                        layout has only 4 columns.

                        Even more importantly, the grid is not a throw-away
                        concept. It is used by both designers and developers
                        alike. Be sure to communicate with your developers the
                        grid structure used when creating the design, so they can
                        implement it accordingly.

                        How you use and set up a grid is fundamental to creating
                        well thought out layouts and experiences for your user.

                        Take time to think through what type of grid ­— column,
                        modular, or hierarchical — best suits your needs. A
                        hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your
                        page will always be more important than the surrounding
                        elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for
                        online news platforms. If the content you need to display
                        is highly variable, consider using a basic column or
                        modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when
                        designing. For example, elements and content can span
                        across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit
                        design needs.

                        Once you have figured out what type of grid will work well
                        for your needs, start setting it up. Determine the number
                        of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to
                        your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare
                        for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid
                        at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for
                        most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as
                        your device size decreases. Wireframing tools like Sketch
                        and Figma have quick and easy ways to set up and edit your
                        grid, even after you have started designing.

                        a grid.

                        base layouts, but they also improve readability and
